Let’s now take a look at our dataset attributes and understand their meaning and significance.

P_USER	category	1-5 , U	Road user class
C_CASE	int64	a number, starting from 752	seems to be the index of data
We have a total of 22 features and our objective is to predict the dependency of the sevirity of a collison (P_ISEV) to these features we will be building and interpreting a classification model.
